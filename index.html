	<h4>Why Personality matthers?</h4>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4 offset1">
			<div>
				<p>
					Personality has been a salient feature of any living entity. Still, it is mostly avoided or undervalued on the grounds of giving importance to other features and factors. Some of them are; educational tools and extra curricular activities. Giving importance to these factors is also important but personality adds value to these factors. This clearly means that personality has the ability to define various characteristics of human beings.  Hello Identity helps in exploring new ways through which one can meet a new identity. This new identity belongs to you and will help in exploring new possibilities of life in an easy and simple manner.

	<h4>Come and then Overcome Social Anxiety</h4>

		<div class="span4 offset1">
			<div>
				<p>
					You are all set to host a presentation. Your palms are clammy, your heart racing, and your throat parched. As you approach the presentation area, your mind begins to get fuzzy. You mumble something and then go completely blank. As you stand there staring blankly at a room full of people, you realize what a jackass you have made of yourself. This is what social anxiety is. Almost all of you have had anxiety attacks at some point of your lives. Overcoming social anxiety is necessary for an individual to succeed in life, as not doing so can create plenty of cracks in relationships at home and in work. Social anxiety at work can affect your career prospects, and anxiety in public places, such as airport and restaurants can affect your capability to meet new people and make friends. Most importantly, anxiety at special occasions such as a party, a night out, or family vacation, can severely damage your bonds with people who are most vital to you. Fortunately, with a little bit of conscious effort, one can overcome this social phobia. We at Hello Identity will help you in overcoming social anxiety with great ease.

	<h4>Don’t Live With Negativity</h4>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4 offset1">
			<div>
				<p>
					Negativity of any type can affect the wellbeing of any individual. Negativity often surfaces when things turn wayward causing immense trouble and issues. There are a number of ways to thwart the progress of negativity and one of them is in the form of effective and compassionate communication. Oftentimes, the value of communication is underestimated whilst focus is often given to technical knowledge. Hello Identity focuses on understanding the negativity aspects of individuals of all ages along with mitigating its influence in a planned manner. Negativity kills positivity that affects long-term growth and development. This is when counseling plays an important role. Someone to listen to and share your ideas is as important as eating, breathing, and surviving. 
						
					Let’s communicate and grow together!

On top of this, she does not have many takers when it comes to understand her mind, desires, and ambitions.  This is where; Hello Identity wans to make a mark. We want to dedicate a course especially to housewives where they can learn, share, and communicate. They are important to make YOU happy and positive and we do the same for them by understanding and valuing them. 

					Come and let’s celebrate the woman in YOU.
